# This is the main entry point of the virtual assistant application.
# It ties together all the modules including configuration, chat logic, text-to-speech,
# LED control, wake-word detection, recording, and speech-to-text conversion.
# The main loop waits for a wake word, processes the user's speech, obtains a response
# from ChatGPT, and then both prints and speaks the response.
# It also provides visual feedback using LEDs during processing.
